# ‚ö° Next.js Bun-Based Modular App

A **feature-based monorepo-style fullstack application** powered by [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), and containerized with Docker. Designed for performance, modularity, and developer experience.

## üí° About This Project
This is a public source base designed to help developers kickstart their Next.js projects with a solid and scalable foundation.

The goal is to create the best possible base structure, assisting developers in building clean, maintainable, and production-ready applications more easily.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a source base with opinionated architecture and **basic authentication (login/logout)** built-in. \
**It is _not_ a real-world or sample business app.** \
You are expected to implement and complete your features based on this foundation.

It adopts a Modular Feature-Based Architecture, which brings several key benefits:

‚úÖ **The Purpose**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each feature is isolated and self-contained, making the codebase easier to navigate and reason about.
- **Scalability:** Well-suited for large projects and growing teams, as it encourages modularity and minimizes tight coupling between features.
- **Code Reusability:** Shared components, hooks, and utilities are placed in appropriate shared directories for maximum reuse.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one feature rarely affect others, reducing regression bugs and making updates safer.
- **Team Collaboration Friendly:** With features organized clearly, multiple developers can work in parallel without conflicts.
- **Consistent Project Structure:** Provides a standardized directory layout, making onboarding faster and project understanding smoother.

This project aims to be a helpful resource for building modern, robust, and maintainable Next.js applications ‚Äî whether you're building a startup MVP, an internal tool, or an open-source product.

## üì¶ Scripts
### Without Docker

| Command                          | Description                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `bun run dev`                    | Run app in development mode      |
| `bun run build`                  | Build app for production         |
| `bun run start`                  | Start production server          |
| `bun run seed`                   | Insert dummy data                |
| `bun run ./src/cronjobs/index.ts` | Run cron jobs (separate)        |

### With Docker

#### Development

```bash
make start-dev
```

- Uses `bun x next dev` for hot reload
- Syncs code via volumes

#### Production

Build container:
```bash
make build-production
```

Start server:
```bash
make start-production
```

- `nextjs-modular-base-prod`: runs the main web app
- `nextjs-modular-base-prod-cron`: runs background cronjobs
